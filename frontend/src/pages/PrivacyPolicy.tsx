        <h2>Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          This service is built with privacy at its core. We use a zero-knowledge architecture,
          which means we <strong>cannot</strong> read your secrets—even if we wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          All encryption and decryption happens entirely in your browser. The encryption key is
          stored only in the URL fragment (the part after the #), which is never sent to our
          servers. This means your secret remains private between you and whoever has the complete
          link.

        <h2>What We Store</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Encrypted data:</strong> Your secret is encrypted in your browser using
            AES-256-GCM before being sent to our servers. We only store the encrypted blob—we have
            no way to decrypt it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Timestamps:</strong> We store the unlock date (when the secret becomes
            accessible) and expiry date (when the secret is permanently deleted).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access tokens:</strong> We generate random tokens to control access to your
            secret (for viewing and editing). These tokens are included in the links you share.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Metadata:</strong> We may collect minimal metadata such as creation timestamps
            and access logs for security and analytics purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section className="info-section">
        <h2>What We Don&apos;t Store</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Encryption keys:</strong> The key to decrypt your secret never leaves your
            browser and is never sent to our servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plaintext content:</strong> We never have access to the unencrypted content of
            your secrets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal information:</strong> We don&apos;t require accounts, emails, or any
            personal information to use this service.

        <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We use minimal or no cookies for this service. Any analytics we collect are aggregated and
          anonymized to help us improve the service. We do not track individual users or sell any
          data to third parties.

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic clearing:</strong> The encrypted content of secrets is automatically
            cleared after their expiry date, whether they were retrieved or not.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>One-time access:</strong> Once a secret is successfully retrieved after its
            unlock date, its encrypted content (ciphertext, initialization vector, and
            authentication tag) is immediately cleared from our servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Metadata retention:</strong> After encrypted content is cleared, we retain
            minimal metadata (timestamps, access tokens) for security and analytics purposes. This
            metadata cannot be used to recover the secret&apos;s content.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take security seriously. Our infrastructure uses industry-standard security practices
          to protect the encrypted data we store. However, since we use zero-knowledge encryption,
          even if our servers were compromised, your secrets would remain protected as long as you
          keep your links private.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your responsibility:</strong> The security of your secret depends on keeping the
          view and edit links private. Anyone with the complete link can access your secret once
          it&apos;s unlocked. Treat these links like passwords.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we
          will notify users through the service. Continued use of the service after changes
          constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
