## How to contribute
- **Report bugs**: Open a GitHub issue with steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.
- **Propose features**: Start with an issue to discuss scope and alignment before opening a PR.
- **Submit pull requests**: Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and open a PR with a clear description of the change.

## Development setup
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies (`make install`), as described in `README.md`.
2. Copy `.env.example` files for backend and frontend and adjust values for your environment.
3. Run `make dev` to start backend and frontend in development mode.

## Coding guidelines
- Follow the existing code style for Python (PEP 8) and TypeScript/React.
- Add or update tests where meaningful, and run `make check` before opening a PR.
- Keep changes focused and well-scoped; large refactors should be discussed first.
