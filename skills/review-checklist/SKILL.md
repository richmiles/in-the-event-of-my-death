# Review Checklist

## Overview

Use this skill to keep reviews consistent: pull the checklist, ask targeted follow-ups by area, and run quick local checks for common debt.

## Quick start
- Ask which areas to emphasize, then load `references/checklist.md` and jump to relevant sections.
- For each category, ask 1–2 prompts from the list; avoid dumping the entire checklist at once.
- Note risk hotspots and propose concrete follow-ups (tests, docs, debt tickets) rather than generic advice.

## Checklist navigation
- **Full list**: See `references/checklist.md` for all categories (style, tests, debt, deps, deploy, security, docs, observability, schema, UX).
- **Repo-specific overlays**: Add any local guardrails in the conversation before applying prompts (e.g., crypto invariants, zero-knowledge rules).
- **When time is short**: Prioritize Security/Privacy → Migrations/Schema → Tests/UX → Docs.

## Lightweight checks
- Search for TODOs/notes: `rg -n \"TODO|FIXME|XXX\"`
- Look for unused deps/imports: `rg -n \"import .*\" frontend backend` plus package manifests for extras
- Lockfile drift: compare declared vs lock versions; note mismatches
- Migrations: confirm up/down symmetry and data safety; flag raw SQL without safeguards
- Logging: scan for secrets or request bodies being logged
